# HM_filemanage
It's a code about Python code for how we can manage multiple extension files by movie them in a suitable format.
If we have many files with different extensions and want only pdfs then how we can find and access them?
Here we can code like this;
File A(Source Folder): Multiple extensions like;
1 .apk	Android package file
2 .txt	Plain text file
3 .bin	Binary file
4 .pdf	Document file
5 .exe	Executable file
...

Now, we want only .exe and .txt files!
so after this .py code, we can get output like this.
Desktop(Destination Folder): 
exe(Folder name):- this.exe , that.exe(Files)
txt(Folder name):- this.txt , that.txt(Files)

So, now we can easily access this kind of multiple and different files into an easily accessible format.
Thank You.
